## Description

I was motivated to make this prework study guide project so that I could better understand the basics of different coding languages. It allows an easy way to look at notes on a particular coding language. I also learned that HTML is used as the foundation of your website, while CSS is used to style it, and JavaScript is used to make it more interactive.

## Usage

This website allows you to easily look at different notes about coding languages and see what some things they allow you to do.
If you open the DevTools console you can see that JavaScript is running and it will choose a random language for you to study!
